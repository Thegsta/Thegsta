# About Me I Guess...

Heya im Thegsta I code and do little projects with my friends or just solo.

## Current Projects

Im working on a fun little fallout 4 mod nothing too big just making something like Fallout: New London but with Moscow (in hindsight its a big project). Im also helping some of my friends with their projects, and i'm also the maybe editor for [@TheAxolotlLord](https://github.com/TheAxolotlLord), fun. I may also work on some other misc. stuff like extensions and other crap.
